*Population dynamics of mutualism and intraspecific density dependence: how Î¸-logistic-like density dependence affects mutualistic positive feedback*
by Christopher M. Moore (me), Sam A. Catella, and Karen C. Abbott

There are two files:

1. NumericalSimulations.R
2. Figures.R

It's pretty straight forward: NumericalSimulations.R conducts the numerical local stability analysis and Figures.R creates all of the figures from the paper.

Each file has the nitty-gritty details under `DESCRPTION`.  In sum, NumericalSimulations.R takes parameters for variables b, d, mu, nu, eta, theta, and beta; loops over the stabilty analysis; and saves the run as a list.  Figures.R pruduces graphs in the device window or in a directory by generating its own data (Figures 1, 2, 4) or from saved output from the NumericaSimulations.R ourputs (Figures 3, 5, 6, 7).
